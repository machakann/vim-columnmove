==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION				*columnmove-introduction*

columnmove serves you several keymappings specialized for moving cursor in
vertical direction.

columnmove-f and its variants~
columnmove-f and its variants are the commands for bringing cursor to the
position assigned by a character in the same column. This group has six
keymappings, that is, |columnmove-f|, |columnmove-t|, |columnmove-F|,
|columnmove-T|, |columnmove-;|, |columnmove-,|.  Each of them are the
imitations of |f|, |t|, |F|, |T|, |;|, |,| command, but work in vertical
direction, not in line-wise.

These commands highlight candidates of destination as
|hl-ColumnmoveCandidates| while waiting your input of a target character. If
you do not like the highlighting, set |g:columnmove_highlight| to 0 as
following. See |g:columnmove_highlight|.
>
	let g:columnmove_highlight = 0
<
In the pending time, user can use <C-e>/<C-y>, <C-d>/<C-u>, <C-f>/<C-b> to
scroll pages. <C-e>/<C-y> navigate by a line, <C-d>/<C-u> do by the value of
'scroll' option (a half of the window height), <C-f>/<C-b> do by a page.

These commands ignore folded lines (see |folds|) in default.  If you want to
search the destination with opening folds, set |g:columnmove_open_fold| to a
non-zero value . A positive and negaive numbers have different roles
respectively, see |g:columnmove_open_fold|. If you just want to open all
folds, please assign |g:columnmove_open_fold| to &foldnestmax as following.
>
	let g:columnmove_open_fold = &foldnestmax
<
Or you can simply set 20, because of the intrinsic restriction of Vim. See
'foldnestmax'.
>
	let g:columnmove_open_fold = 20
<


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
columnmove-w and its variants~
columnmove-w and its variants are the commands for moving cursor in word-wise.
This group has eight keymappings, that is, |columnmove-w|, |columnmove-b|,
|columnmove-e|, |columnmove-ge|, |columnmove-W|, |columnmove-B|,
|columnmove-E|, |columnmove-gE|. Each of them are the imitations of |w|, |b|,
|e|, |ge|, |W|, |B|, |E|, |gE|, but work in vertical direction. These commands
regard the column which cursor is on as a line and search for the head or tail
of word to move.  These commands regard a empty part of the column (like empty
lines) as a space to skip it. For example, assume a Vim script code like this:
>
	let foo = 1
	let bar = 2

	" addition
	let addition = foo + bar

	echo foo
	echo bar
	echo addition
<
Cut out the first column.
>
	l
	l

	"
	l

	e
	e
	e
<
Regard it as a line.
>
	ll "l eee
<
Empty columns are converted to spaces. Words are defined by using the option
'iskeyword'. Usually '"' is not keyword in vimscript code. Thus if the cursor
is placed on the first `l`, w command brings cursor like:
		`"` -> `l` -> `e`~
Hence |columnmove-w| command bring cursor to the first column of fourth,
fifth, and, seventh lines from the first column of first line.

In principle these commands equates empty lines and spaces and does not stop
the cursor on a space. However there is an exception, if the space is
adjuscent with an empty line the cursor would be stopped at there, the white
spaces as indentation are regarded as empty in this case. If you do not want
to stop the cursor on a space, set |g:columnmove_stop_on_space| as 0.

However, actually, almost all the programming languages are semantic in
line-wise, not column-wise. Thus these "strict" commands might not be useful
always. Then why don't you try "spoiled" commands with following
configuration?
>
	let g:columnmove_strict_wbege = 0
<
With this configuration, |columnmove-w| and its variants do not think whether
characters are included in 'iskeyword' or not. Just judge whether there is a
empty or a character. Here, write again the first column of the example code.
>
	l
	l

	"
	l

	e
	e
	e
<
"spoiled" commands would stop cursor on the fourth and seventh line since
""l" and "eee" are strings which are separated by empty line. It means that if
there is a space, even stops cursor there.

these commands also ignore folded lines. it means that commands think that
there is nothing for folded parts. if |g:columnmove_fold_treatment| is set as
1, commands regard folded lines as a empty line.
>
	let g:columnmove_fold_treatment = 1
<
it sounds like same, but actually slightly different in some cases. assume
the code like this:
>
	first line
	second line
	---folded lines---
	third line
	fourth line
	
	fifth line
	sixth line
<
if cursor is on the first line and columnmove-w is used, cursor will move to
fifth line. Because these commands ignore folded lines.
>
	first line
	second line
	third line
	fourth line
	
	fifth line
	sixth line
<
however |g:columnmove_fold_treatment| is set as 1, cursor will move to third
line. Because these commands regard folded lines as a empty line.
>
	first line
	second line
	
	third line
	fourth line
	
	fifth line
	sixth line

KEYMAPPINGS				*columnmove-keymappings*

This plugin defines following keymappings.

functions		keymappings			default keymappings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|columnmove-f|		<Plug>(columnmove-f)		<M-f>
|columnmove-t|		<Plug>(columnmove-t)		<M-t>
|columnmove-F|		<Plug>(columnmove-F)		<M-F>
|columnmove-T|		<Plug>(columnmove-T)		<M-T>
|columnmove-;|		<Plug>(columnmove-;)		<M-;>
|columnmove-,|		<Plug>(columnmove-,)		<M-,>

|columnmove-b|		<Plug>(columnmove-b)		<M-b>
|columnmove-e|		<Plug>(columnmove-e)		<M-e>
|columnmove-ge|		<Plug>(columnmove-ge)		g<M-e>
							 and
							<M-g><M-e>

|columnmove-W|		<Plug>(columnmove-W)		<M-W>
|columnmove-B|		<Plug>(columnmove-B)		<M-B>
|columnmove-E|		<Plug>(columnmove-E)		<M-E>
|columnmove-gE|		<Plug>(columnmove-gE)		g<M-E>
							 and
							<M-g><M-E>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

					*g:columnmove_no_default_key_mappings*
If you do not need default keymappings, define a variable named
|g:columnmove_no_default_key_mappings| in your vimrc.
>
	let g:columnmove_no_default_key_mappings = 1
<
Then the default mappings are never applied, map them again by yourself as you
like.

These keymappings can accept [count] assignment. If [count] is assigned,
cursor will go to the [count]th destination.

These keymappings are available with |:nmap|, |:xmap|, |:omap|, |:imap|.

The default keymappings work as |linewise| and also work well with |o_v|,
|o_V|, |o_CTRL-V|. If you want to remap with |:omap|, it is recommended to use
the following trick to do well with |o_v|, |o_V|, |o_CTRL-V|. This description
makes it as you expect.
>
	omap      <M-f>      <Plug>(columnmove-f)
	omap     v<M-f>     v<Plug>(columnmove-f)
	omap     V<M-f>     V<Plug>(columnmove-f)
	omap <C-v><M-f> <C-v><Plug>(columnmove-f)
<
Or using the supplementary function |columnmove#utility#map()| is easier way
to do it.
Note that these keymappings are defined as |meta| key modified key
sequences (see |<M-|) and it would not be valid in cui environments. If you
are using |gvim| it is no problem, but if not then you may need to remap other
key sequences. The following example remaps key sequences prefixed by '\',
like '\f', '\w'.
>
	for s:x in split('ftFT;,wbeWBE', '\zs') + ['ge', 'gE']
	  call columnmove#utility#map('nxo', s:x, '\' . s:x, 'block')
	endfor

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				*columnmove-configuration*

There are several variables to control the behavior of keymappings. You can
use same variable name with different scopes, buffer local 'b:' and global
'g:'. If a same variable name is defined in different scopes, b: is prior to
g:.

Related to all the mappings~
g:columnmove_open_fold			*g:columnmove_open_fold*
	The number of levels to open the fold when cursor is moved.
	If a positive value is assigned, opens folds which fold level is equal
	to or below the value.
	If a negative value is assigned, the opening level is determined
	relative to the level of the current cursor position.  For instance,
	when g:columnmove_open_fold is -2 and cursor is on the line which fold
	level is 1, then commands would open folds up to the level 3
	(= 1-(-2)).
	If 0 is assigned, do not open any fold and just skip them.
	The default value is 0.

	This option can be assigned as a dictionary instead of a number.
>
	let g:columnmove_open_fold = {'x' : &foldnestmax, 'i' : -1}
<
	This description allows to assign different rules to different
	|vim-modes|. Following characters can be used to assign each modes as
	a key name of the dictionary.

	'n' : normal mode
	'x' : visual mode
	'o' : operator-pending mode
	'i' : insert mode

Related to columnmove-f command and its variants~
g:columnmove_ignore_case		*g:columnmove_ignore_case*
	If the value is 1, |columnmove-f| series commands move case-sensitive.
	If the value is 0, these commands move case-insensitive.
	The default value is 0.

g:columnmove_highlight			*g:columnmove_highlight*
	If the value is not 0, candidates highlighting is valid in
	|columnmove-f| and its variants. If the value is 0, the highlighting
	is tunred off. The default value is 1.

g:columnmove_update_history		*g:columnmove_update_history*
	If the value is 0, do not update the history for |columnmove-;| and
	|columnmove-,|.  The default value is 1.

Related to columnmove-w command and its variants~
g:columnmove_strict_wbege		*g:columnmove_strict_wbege*
	If the value is not 0, applys the strict rule to move cursor. If the
	value is 0, the spoiled rule is used. See |columnmove-introduction|.
	The default value is 1.

g:columnmove_fold_treatment		*g:columnmove_fold_treatment*
	If the value is 0, these commands ignore folded lines.
	If the value is 1, commands regard folded lines as a empty line.
	The default value is 0.

g:columnmove_stop_on_space		*g:columnmove_stop_on_space*
	If the value is 0, these commands never stops the cursor on a space.
	If the value is 1, the cursor is stopped at a space adjuscent with an
	empty line. The default value is 1.


==============================================================================
FUNCTIONS				*columnmove-functions*

columnmove-f and its variants~
columnmove-f and its variants keymappings have corresponding functions. They
have similar interface as following:
>
  columnmove#xxx(mode, mwise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]])
<
The part filled by "xxx" is a name of its original command. You can use "f",
"t", "F", "T", "semicolon", "comma". When you use these functions, map with
<expr> option.

The first and the second arguments are necessary, but others are optional.

The first argument "mode" is a character that represents a mode mapped for.
These commands can be mapped for |:nmap|, |:xmap|, |:omap|, and, |:imap|, thus
assgin 'n', 'x', 'o', and, 'i' respectively.

The second argument "mwise" is a character to determine the behavior
(motionwise) in operator pending mode. Thus, for the modes other than the
operator pending mode, just give an empty string ''. For the operator pending
mode, give '', 'v', 'V' or "\<C-v>" according to your preference.

	mwise		motionwise in operator-pending mode
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	''		|exclusive| |characterwise|
	'v'		|inclusive| |characterwise|
	'V'		|linewise|
	"\<C-v>"	blockwise (see |blockwise-examples| and |o_CTRL-V|)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third argument "count" is a number. If a positive number is assigned,
functions would always ignore [count] and use the assigned number. If zero or
a negative number is assigned, functions refer [count] as usual.

The fourth argument "options_dictionary" is a dictionary which can force to
use given values of configuration variables. For example, assume you want to
use ignore case always, then use this argument like this:
>
	nnoremap <silent><expr> <M-f> columnmove#f('n', '',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})
<
If you want to use with |:xmap|, use like this:
>
	xnoremap <silent><expr> <M-f> columnmove#f('x', '',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})
<
If you want to use with |:imap|, use like this:
>
	inoremap <silent><expr> <M-f> columnmove#f('i', '',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})
<
If you want to use with |:omap|, I suggest to check the notice at
|columnmove-keymappings| and map like this:
>
	onoremap <silent><expr>      <M-f> columnmove#f('o', 'V',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})

	onoremap <silent><expr>     v<M-f> columnmove#f('o', '',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})

	onoremap <silent><expr>     V<M-f> columnmove#f('o', 'V',
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})

	onoremap <silent><expr> <C-v><M-f> columnmove#f('o', "\<C-v>",
		\				0, {'ignore_case' : 1})
<
The key names are the name of configuration variables removing first
"g:columnmove_". That is "open_fold", "ignore_case", "highlight",
"update_history" can be used.
Please see |columnmove-configuration|.

The fifth argument "target" is a character. If you have already determined
the target character, you can assign here. If empty string '' is assigned,
then the functions would ask when they are called as usual.



					*columnmove#f()*
columnmove#f(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-f|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.

					*columnmove#t()*
columnmove#t(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-t|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.

					*columnmove#F()*
columnmove#F(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-F|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.

					*columnmove#T()*
columnmove#T(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-T|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.


As for the following two commands, the fifth argument "target" is omitted.

					*columnmove#semicolon()*
columnmove#semicolon(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-;|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.

					*columnmove#comma()*
columnmove#comma(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-,|. This function should be
	used with <expr> option of map commands.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
columnmove-w and its variants~
columnmove-w and its variants keymappings have corresponding functions. They
have similar interface as following:
>
  columnmove#xxx(mode, mwise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
<
The part filled by "xxx" is a character of original commands. That is, "w",
"b", "e", "ge", "W", "B", "E", "gE". Unlike the columnmove-f and its variants,
<expr> option is not required.

The first and the second arguments are necessary, but others are optional.

The first argument "mode" is a character that represents a mode mapped for.
These commands can be mapped for |:nmap|, |:xmap|, |:omap|, and, |:imap|, thus
assgin 'n', 'x', 'o', and, 'i' respectively.

The second argument "mwise" is a character to determine the behavior
(motionwise) in operator pending mode. Thus, for the modes other than the
operator pending mode, just give an empty string ''. For the operator pending
mode, give '', 'v', 'V' or "\<C-v>" according to your preference.

	mwise		motionwise in operator-pending mode
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	''		|exclusive| |characterwise|
	'v'		|inclusive| |characterwise|
	'V'		|linewise|
	"\<C-v>"	blockwise (see |blockwise-examples| and |o_CTRL-V|)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The third argument "count" is a number. If a positive number is assigned,
functions would always ignore [count] and use the assigned number. If zero or
a negative number are assigned, functions refer [count] as usual.

The fourth argument "options_dictionary" is a dictionary which can force to
use given values of configuration variables. For example, if you want to open
folds always, then use this argument like this:
>
	nnoremap <silent> <M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('n', '',
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>
<
If you want to use with |:xmap|, use like this:
>
	xnoremap <silent> <M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('x', ''
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>
<
If you want to use with |:imap|, use like this:
>
	inoremap <silent> <M-w> <C-r>=columnmove#w('i', ''
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>
<
If you want to use with |:omap|, I suggest to check the notice at
|columnmove-keymappings| and map like this:
>
	onoremap <silent>      <M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('o', 'V'
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>

	onoremap <silent>     v<M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('o', ''
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>

	onoremap <silent>     V<M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('o', 'V'
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>

	onoremap <silent> <C-v><M-w> :<C-u>call columnmove#w('o', "\<C-v>"
		\				0, {'fold_open' : 20})<CR>
<

The key names are the name of configuration variables removing first
"g:columnmove_". That is "open_fold", "strict_wbege", "fold_treatment" can be
used. Please see |columnmove-configuration|.



					*columnmove#w()*
columnmove#w(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-w|.

					*columnmove#b()*
columnmove#b(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-b|.

					*columnmove#e()*
columnmove#e(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-e|.

					*columnmove#ge()*
columnmove#ge(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-ge|.

					*columnmove#W()*
columnmove#W(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-W|.

					*columnmove#B()*
columnmove#B(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-B|.

					*columnmove#E()*
columnmove#E(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-E|.

					*columnmove#gE()*
columnmove#gE(mode, wise[, count[, options_dictionary]])
	The function corresponds to |columnmove-gE|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supplementary function~

There are many keymapping functions. They are not easy to use and the required
description easily gets tremendous in exchange of the degree of freedom. To
alleviate the situation there is a supplementary function to make keymappings
for several modes automatically.

					*columnmove#utility#map()*
>
  columnmove#utility#map(mode, kind, lhs[, mwise])

  " if kind is 'f', 't', 'F', 'T', ';' or ','
  columnmove#utility#map(mode, kind, lhs
		\ [, mwise[, count[, options_dictionary[, target]]]])

  " if kind is 'w', 'b', 'e', 'ge', 'W', 'B', 'E' or 'gE'
  columnmove#utility#map(mode, kind, lhs
		\ [, mwise[, count[, options_dictionary]]])
<

	This function is used in order to simplify the description of
	keymapping declarations.
>
	nnoremap <silent><expr>      \f columnmove#f('n', '')
	xnoremap <silent><expr>      \f columnmove#f('x', '')
	onoremap <silent><expr>      \f columnmove#f('o', 'V')
	onoremap <silent><expr>     v\f columnmove#f('o', '')
	onoremap <silent><expr>     V\f columnmove#f('o', 'V')
	onoremap <silent><expr> <C-v>\f columnmove#f('o', "<Bslash><lt>C-v>")

	" The above descriptions could be replaced by the line
	call columnmove#utility#map('nxo', 'f', '\f')
<
	The first argument "mode" is a string contains 'n', 'x', 'o' and 'i'
	which user needs.

	The second argument "kind" is the string to specify the columnmove
	command. 'f', 'F', 't', 'T', ';', ',', 'w', 'b', 'e', "ge", 'W', 'B',
	'E', "gE" can be used.

	The third argument "lhs" is treated as {lhs} of |:map| command.

	The fourth argument "mwise" is optional, this argument assigns the
	default motionwise in operator-pending mode.

		|characterwise|: 'v' or "char" (inclusive) or '' (exclusive)
		|linewise|     : 'V' or "line"
		blockwise    : "\<C-v>" or "block"

	The following optional arguments "target",
	"count", "options_dictionary" are same as |columnmove#f()| and
	|columnmove#w()|.

	For example, Alt key is not valid to use in cui environment, use this
	function with |g:columnmove_no_default_key_mappings|.
>
	let g:columnmove_no_default_key_mappings = 1
	call columnmove#utility#map('nxo', 'f', '\f')
	call columnmove#utility#map('nxo', 'F', '\F')
